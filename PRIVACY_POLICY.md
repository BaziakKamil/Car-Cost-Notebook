### Car Cost Notebook: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Car Cost Notebook app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Kamil Baziak. 
The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license. 
The app is also available on Google Play.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information.
All data (database) and backup files are stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.
Backup folder with backup files is created under Documents section in folder named "Car Cost Notebook Backup". You can delete it anytime.

Only data that is collected are bugs. Firebase Crashlytics is implemented and if any bugs or crash appears it sends info back to developers console.
But none of users private data is sent only bug trace.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protects your privacy, 
please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Happy using the app.

Kamil Baziak
